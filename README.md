# Object-Oriented Programming Assignment

This project contains two Python exercises demonstrating OOP concepts:

## 1. class_design.py
- Creates a custom class (`Superhero`)
- Uses a constructor to initialize attributes
- Demonstrates inheritance with a subclass (`FlyingHero`)
- Includes methods to simulate behavior

## 2. polymorphism_challenge.py
- Demonstrates polymorphism using a `move()` method
- Different classes (Car, Plane, Bicycle) override the same method
- Shows how one function call can trigger different behaviors

## How to Run
python class_design.py
python polymorphism_challenge.py
